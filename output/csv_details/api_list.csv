AmazonS3,AbortMultipartUpload,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html,"This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no
         additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any
         previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in
         progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary
         to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage
         consumed by all parts.

To verify that all parts have been removed and prevent getting charged for the part
         storage, you should call the ListParts API operation and ensure
         that the parts list is empty.

Note
          
          
      
            
               Directory buckets - If multipart
                  uploads in a directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until
                  all the in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed. To delete these
                  in-progress multipart uploads, use the ListMultipartUploads operation
                  to list the in-progress multipart uploads in the bucket and use the
                     AbortMultipartUpload operation to abort all the in-progress
                  multipart uploads. 
         
            
               Directory buckets -
                  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
               . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.

AmazonS3,CompleteMultipartUpload,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CompleteMultipartUpload.html,"Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart
         operation or the UploadPartCopy operation.
         After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this
            CompleteMultipartUpload operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving
         this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a
         new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload request, you must provide the parts list and
         ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation
         concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must
         provide the PartNumber value and the ETag value that are returned
         after that part was uploaded.

The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to
         finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that
         specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3
         periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request
         could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent. This means that a
            200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. The error
         response might be embedded in the 200 OK response. If you call this API
         operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the
         response and handle it appropriately. If you use AWS SDKs, SDKs handle this condition.
         The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings
         (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists,
         the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an
         error).

Note that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared
         to retry any failed requests (including 500 error responses). For more information, see
            Amazon S3 Error
            Best Practices.

ImportantYou can't use Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded for the
            CompleteMultipartUpload requests. Also, if you don't provide a Content-Type
            header, CompleteMultipartUpload can still return a 200 OK
            response.

For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart
            Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Note
         Directory buckets -
            For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name

AmazonS3,CopyObject,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html,"Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

NoteYou can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your
            object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an
            object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy
            (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the
               REST Multipart Upload API.

You can copy individual objects between general purpose buckets, between directory buckets,
         and between general purpose buckets and directory buckets.

Note
          
          
          
      
            Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Multi-Region Access Points only as a
                  destination when using the Multi-Region Access Point ARN. 
         
            
               Directory buckets  -
                  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
               . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.
         
            VPC endpoints don't support cross-Region requests (including copies). If you're
                  using VPC endpoints, your source and destination buckets should be in the same
                  AWS Region as your VPC endpoint.

Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to
         copy the object to must be enabled for your account. For more information about how to
         enable a Region for your account, see Enable or disable a Region for standalone accounts in the 
         AWS
            Account Management Guide.

ImportantAmazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a
            cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad
               Request error. For more information, see Transfer
            Acceleration.

Authentication and authorization
         
            All CopyObject requests must be authenticated and signed by using
                  IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities).
                  All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including
                     x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. For more information, see
                     REST Authentication.
            
               Directory buckets - You must use the
                  IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the
                     CopyObject API operation, instead of using the temporary security
                  credentials through the CreateSession API operation.
            
               AWS CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your
                  behalf.
         
       
         Permissions
         
            You must have read access to the source object and
                     write access to the destination bucket.
            
                
                
            
                  
                     General purpose bucket permissions - You
                        must have permissions in an IAM policy based on the source and destination
                        bucket types in a CopyObject operation.
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have
                                 
                              s3:GetObject
                           
                              permission to read the source object that is being copied. 
                     
                        If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have
                                 
                              s3:PutObject
                           
                              permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket. 
                     
               
                  
                     Directory bucket permissions -
                        You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the
                        source and destination bucket types in a CopyObject
                        operation.
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        If the source object that you want to copy is in a
                              directory bucket, you must have the 
                              s3express:CreateSession
                            permission in
                              the Action element of a policy to read the object. By
                              default, the session is in the ReadWrite mode. If you
                              want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the
                                 s3express:SessionMode condition key to
                                 ReadOnly on the copy source bucket.
                     
                        If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the
                                 
                              s3express:CreateSession
                            permission in the
                                 Action element of a policy to write the object to the
                              destination. The s3express:SessionMode condition key
                              can't be set to ReadOnly on the copy destination bucket.
                           
                     
                  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
                           kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions
                        in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS
                        key.
                  For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for
                           S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
               
         
       
         Response and special errors
         
            When the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. When
                  the request is not an HTTP 1.1 request, the response would not contain the
                     Content-Length. You always need to read the entire response body
                  to check if the copy succeeds. 
            
                
                
            
                  If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about
                        the copied object.
               
                  A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request
                        or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. A 200 OK response can
                        contain either a success or an error.
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a
                              standard Amazon S3 error.
                     
                        If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response
                              is embedded in the 200 OK response. For example, in a
                              cross-region copy, you may encounter throttling and receive a
                                 200 OK response. For more information, see Resolve the Error 200 response when copying objects to
                                 Amazon S3. The 200 OK status code means the copy
                              was accepted, but it doesn't mean the copy is complete. Another
                              example is when you disconnect from Amazon S3 before the copy is complete,
                              Amazon S3 might cancel the copy and you may receive a 200 OK
                              response. You must stay connected to Amazon S3 until the entire response is
                              successfully received and processed.
                        If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your
                              application to parse the content of the response and handle it
                              appropriately. If you use AWS SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The
                              SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your
                              configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request
                              as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an
                              exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an
                              error).
                     
               
         
       
         Charge
         
            The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you
                  specify for the destination object. The request can also result in a data
                  retrieval charge for the source if the source storage class bills for data
                  retrieval. If the copy source is in a different region, the data transfer is
                  billed to the copy source account. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing.

                     Amazon S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the REST API, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the 
                     form 
                        AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. The hostname isn't required when you use the AWS CLI or SDKs.

AmazonS3,CreateBucket,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html,"NoteThis action creates an Amazon S3 bucket. To create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see CreateBucket.

Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must set up Amazon S3 and have a valid AWS
         Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create
         buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

There are two types of buckets: general purpose buckets and directory buckets. For more
         information about these bucket types, see Creating, configuring, and
            working with Amazon S3 buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Note
          
          
      
            
               General purpose buckets - If you send your
                     CreateBucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com global
                  endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. So the signature
                  calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region,
                  even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the
                  bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N.
                  Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more
                  information, see Virtual hosting of
                     buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
         
            
               Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
               . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. 
For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

Permissions
         
            
                
                
            
                  
                     General purpose bucket permissions - In
                        addition to the s3:CreateBucket permission, the following
                        permissions are required in a policy when your CreateBucket
                        request includes specific headers: 
                  
                      
                      
                      
                      
                  
                        
                           Access control lists (ACLs)
                              - In your CreateBucket request, if you specify an
                              access control list (ACL) and set it to public-read,
                                 public-read-write, authenticated-read, or
                              if you explicitly specify any other custom ACLs, both
                                 s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl
                              permissions are required. In your CreateBucket request,
                              if you set the ACL to private, or if you don't specify
                              any ACLs, only the s3:CreateBucket permission is
                              required. 
                     
                        
                           Object Lock - In your
                                 CreateBucket request, if you set
                                 x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled to true, the
                                 s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration and
                                 s3:PutBucketVersioning permissions are
                              required.
                     
                        
                           S3 Object Ownership - If
                              your CreateBucket request includes the
                                 x-amz-object-ownership header, then the
                                 s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls permission is
                              required.
                        Important To set an ACL on a bucket as part of a
                                    CreateBucket request, you must explicitly set S3
                                 Object Ownership for the bucket to a different value than the
                                 default, BucketOwnerEnforced. Additionally, if your
                                 desired bucket ACL grants public access, you must first create the
                                 bucket (without the bucket ACL) and then explicitly disable Block
                                 Public Access on the bucket before using PutBucketAcl
                                 to set the ACL. If you try to create a bucket with a public ACL,
                                 the request will fail.  For the majority of modern use cases in S3, we recommend that
                                 you keep all Block Public Access settings enabled and keep ACLs
                                 disabled. If you would like to share data with users outside of
                                 your account, you can use bucket policies as needed. For more
                                 information, see Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your
                                    bucket  and Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage  in
                                 the Amazon S3 User Guide. 
                     
                        
                           S3 Block Public Access - If
                              your specific use case requires granting public access to your S3
                              resources, you can disable Block Public Access. Specifically, you can
                              create a new bucket with Block Public Access enabled, then separately
                              call the DeletePublicAccessBlock API. To use this operation, you must have the
                                 s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock permission. For more
                              information about S3 Block Public Access, see Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage  in the
                                 Amazon S3 User Guide. 
                     
               
                  
                     Directory bucket permissions -
                        You must have the s3express:CreateBucket permission in
                        an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the AWS account that owns the resource.
                        For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
                  ImportantThe permissions for ACLs, Object Lock, S3 Object Ownership, and S3
                           Block Public Access are not supported for directory buckets. For
                           directory buckets, all Block Public Access settings are enabled at the
                           bucket level and S3 Object Ownership is set to Bucket owner enforced
                           (ACLs disabled). These settings can't be modified. For more information about permissions for creating and working with
                           directory buckets, see Directory buckets in the
                              Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about
                           supported S3 features for directory buckets, see Features of S3 Express One Zone in the
                              Amazon S3 User Guide.

bedrock,CreateGuardrail,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGuardrail.html,"Creates a guardrail to block topics and to implement safeguards for your generative AI applications.

You can configure the following policies in a guardrail to avoid undesirable and harmful content, filter 
        out denied topics and words, and remove sensitive information for privacy protection.

Content filters - Adjust filter strengths
              to block input prompts or model responses containing harmful content.
      
         
            Denied topics - Define a set of topics that
              are undesirable in the context of your application. These topics will be blocked if
              detected in user queries or model responses.
      
         
            Word filters - Configure filters to block
              undesirable words, phrases, and profanity. Such words can include offensive terms, 
              competitor names etc.
      
         
            Sensitive information filters - Block or
              mask sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or custom 
              regex in user inputs and model responses.

In addition to the above policies, you can also configure the messages to be returned to 
        the user if a user input or model response is in violation of the policies defined in the guardrail.

AmazonS3,CreateMultipartUpload,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html,"This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is
         used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this
         upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see UploadPart). You also include this
         upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.
         For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview in the
            Amazon S3 User Guide.

NoteAfter you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being
            charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart
            upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stops charging you for
            storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.

If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the
         created multipart upload must be completed within the number of days specified in the
         bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible
         for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle
         Configuration.

               Directory buckets  -
                  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
               . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

Request signing
         
            For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You
                  initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then
                  complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There
                  is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information
                  about signing, see Authenticating
                     Requests (AWS Signature Version 4) in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide.
         
       
         Permissions
         
            
                
                
            
                  
                     General purpose bucket permissions - To
                        perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
                        KMS key, the requester must have permission to the
                           kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey actions on
                        the key. The requester must also have permissions for the
                           kms:GenerateDataKey action for the
                           CreateMultipartUpload API. Then, the requester needs
                        permissions for the kms:Decrypt action on the
                           UploadPart and UploadPartCopy APIs. These
                        permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the
                        encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more
                        information, see Multipart upload API and permissions and Protecting data
                           using server-side encryption with AWS KMS in the
                           Amazon S3 User Guide.
               
                  
                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.
               
         
       
         Encryption
         
            
                
                
            
                  
                     General purpose buckets - Server-side
                        encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
                        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it.
                        Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3
                        bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption
                        information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is
                        set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By
                        default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses
                        server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination
                        bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side
                        encryption with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided
                        encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a
                        customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a
                        CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of
                        encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3
                        encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed
                        key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting
                        in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of
                        the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes
                        precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request
                        headers you provide in UploadPart and
                           UploadPartCopy
                        requests must match the headers you used in the
                           CreateMultipartUpload request.
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the AWS managed key
                                 (aws/s3) and AWS KMS customer managed keys stored in AWS Key Management Service
                              (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data,
                              specify the following headers in the request.

                                       Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed key (aws/s3 key) in
                                       AWS KMS to protect the data.
                              
                                 To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an
                                       AWS KMS key, the requester must have permission to the
                                          kms:Decrypt and
                                          kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key.
                                       These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and
                                       read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes
                                       the multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions and Protecting data using server-side encryption with AWS

                                       AWS account as the KMS key, then you must have these
                                       permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role is
                                       in a different account from the key, then you must have the

                     Directory buckets -
                        For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your 
            CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects 
 are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more
         information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS for new object uploads.
                  In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the CreateSession request. 
                            You can't override the values of the encryption settings (x-amz-server-side-encryption, x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, x-amz-server-side-encryption-context, and x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled) that are specified in the CreateSession request. 
                            You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and   
                            Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the CreateSession request to protect new objects in the directory bucket. 
                           
                  NoteWhen you use the CLI or the AWS SDKs, for CreateSession, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the AWS SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the 
                            CreateSession request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the CreateSession request. 
                            So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy), 
          the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.

                  NoteFor directory buckets, when you perform a
                              CreateMultipartUpload operation and an
                              UploadPartCopy operation, the request headers you provide
                           in the CreateMultipartUpload request must match the default
                           encryption configuration of the destination bucket.

AmazonS3,CreateSession,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html,"Creates a session that establishes temporary security credentials to support fast
         authentication and authorization for the Zonal endpoint API operations on directory buckets. For more
         information about Zonal endpoint API operations that include the Availability Zone in the request endpoint, see S3 Express One Zone
            APIs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the CreateSession
         API operation. Specifically, you grant s3express:CreateSession permission to a
         bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make the
            CreateSession API request on the bucket, which returns temporary security
         credentials that include the access key ID, secret access key, session token, and
         expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to access the Zonal endpoint API operations. After
         the session is created, you don’t need to use other policies to grant permissions to each
         Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by
         applying the temporary security credentials of the session to the request headers and
         following the SigV4 protocol for authentication. You also apply the session token to the
            x-amz-s3session-token request header for authorization. Temporary security
         credentials are scoped to the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration time,
         any calls that you make with those credentials will fail. You must use IAM credentials
         again to make a CreateSession API request that generates a new set of
         temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials cannot be extended or refreshed beyond
         the original specified interval.

If you use AWS SDKs, SDKs handle the session token refreshes automatically to avoid
         service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to
         initiate and manage requests to the CreateSession API. For more information, see Performance guidelines and design patterns in the
            Amazon S3 User Guide.

Note
          
          
          
      
            You must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.
         
            
               
                  CopyObject API operation -
                  Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the CopyObject API operation doesn't use
                  the temporary security credentials returned from the CreateSession
                  API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about
                  authentication and authorization of the CopyObject API operation on
                  directory buckets, see CopyObject.
         
            
               
                  HeadBucket API operation -
                  Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the HeadBucket API operation doesn't use
                  the temporary security credentials returned from the CreateSession
                  API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about
                  authentication and authorization of the HeadBucket API operation on
                  directory buckets, see HeadBucket.

Permissions
         
            To obtain temporary security credentials, you must create
                  a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy that grants s3express:CreateSession
                  permission to the bucket. In a policy, you can have the
                     s3express:SessionMode condition key to control who can create a
                     ReadWrite or ReadOnly session. For more information
                  about ReadWrite or ReadOnly sessions, see x-amz-create-session-mode. For example policies, see
                     Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for
                     S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide. 
            To grant cross-account access to Zonal endpoint API operations, the bucket policy should also
                  grant both accounts the s3express:CreateSession permission.
            If you want to encrypt objects with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
                     kms:GenerateDataKey and the kms:Decrypt permissions
                  in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the target AWS KMS
                  key.
         
       
         Encryption
         
            For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your 
            CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects 
 are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more
         information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS for new object uploads.
            For Zonal endpoint (object-level) API operations except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy,  
you authenticate and authorize requests through CreateSession for low latency. 
                            To encrypt new objects in a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a customer managed key). Then, when a session is created for Zonal endpoint API operations, new objects are automatically encrypted and decrypted with SSE-KMS and S3 Bucket Keys during the session.
            Note
                            Only 1 customer managed key is supported per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. The AWS managed key (aws/s3) isn't supported. 
                            After you specify SSE-KMS as your bucket's default encryption configuration with a customer managed key, you can't change the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.
                            
            In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy) using the REST API, 
                            you can't override the values of the encryption settings (x-amz-server-side-encryption, x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, x-amz-server-side-encryption-context, and x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled) from the CreateSession request. 
                            You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and   
                            Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the CreateSession request to protect new objects in the directory bucket. 
                           
            NoteWhen you use the CLI or the AWS SDKs, for CreateSession, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the AWS SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the 
                            CreateSession request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the CreateSession request. 
                            Also, in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy), 
          it's not supported to override the values of the encryption settings from the CreateSession request.

Deletes the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is  the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

AmazonS3,DeleteObject,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html,"Removes an object from a bucket. The behavior depends on the bucket's versioning state:

If bucket versioning is not enabled, the operation permanently deletes the object.
      
         If bucket versioning is enabled, the operation inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current version of the object. To permanently delete an object in a versioned bucket, you must include the object’s versionId in the request. For more information about versioning-enabled buckets, see Deleting object versions from a versioning-enabled bucket.
      
         If bucket versioning is suspended, the operation removes the object that has a null versionId, if there is one, and inserts a delete marker that becomes the current version of the object. If there isn't an object with a null versionId, and all versions of the object have a versionId, Amazon S3 does not remove the object and only inserts a delete marker. To permanently delete an object that has a versionId, you must include the object’s versionId in the request. For more information about versioning-suspended buckets, see Deleting objects from versioning-suspended buckets.

Note
          
          
      
            
               Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the null value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify null 
               to the versionId query parameter in the request.
         
            
               Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
               . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

To remove a specific version, you must use the versionId query parameter. Using this
         query parameter permanently deletes the version. If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3
         sets the response header x-amz-delete-marker to true.

If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning
         configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the x-amz-mfa request
         header in the DELETE versionId request. Requests that include
         x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS. For more information about MFA Delete, see Using MFA Delete in the Amazon S3
               User Guide. To see sample
         requests that use versioning, see Sample
            Request.

Note
         Directory buckets - MFA delete is not supported by directory buckets.

You can delete objects by explicitly calling DELETE Object or calling  
         (PutBucketLifecycle) to enable Amazon S3 to remove them for you. If you want to block
         users or accounts from removing or deleting objects from your bucket, you must deny them
         the s3:DeleteObject, s3:DeleteObjectVersion, and
         s3:PutLifeCycleConfiguration actions.

Note
         Directory buckets - S3 Lifecycle is not supported by directory buckets.

                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.

AmazonS3,DeleteObjects,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObjects.html,"This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP
         request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides
         a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request
         overhead.

The request can contain a list of up to 1,000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you
         provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific
         version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a
         delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success or failure, in the response.
         If the object specified in the request isn't found, Amazon S3 confirms the deletion by returning the result as deleted.

                  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name

    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the
         operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each
         key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete
         operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet mode, the operation
         does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any
         versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire
         request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you
         provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the
         entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see MFA
            Delete in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

            MFA delete is not supported by directory buckets.

         enables you to perform faster data transfers to and from Amazon S3.

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the

You set the Transfer Acceleration state of an existing bucket to Enabled or

A GET accelerate request does not return a state value for a bucket that
         has no transfer acceleration state. A bucket has no Transfer Acceleration state if a state
         has never been set on the bucket.

Gets the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is  the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

         Management.

Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object
         key name prefix, one or more object tags, object size, or any combination of these.
         Accordingly, this section describes the latest API, which is compatible with the new
         functionality. The previous version of the API supported filtering based only on an object
         key name prefix, which is supported for general purpose buckets for backward compatibility.
         For the related API description, see GetBucketLifecycle.

NoteLifecyle configurations for directory buckets only support expiring objects and
            cancelling multipart uploads. Expiring of versioned objects, transitions and tag filters
            are not supported.

Note
         Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
         . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. 
For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

Permissions
         
            If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that
                  owns the bucket, the calling identity must both have the
                     GetBucketPolicy permissions on the specified bucket and belong to
                  the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.
            If you don't have GetBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a
                     403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but
                  you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3
                  returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.
            ImportantTo ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of
                     their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's AWS account can
                     perform the GetBucketPolicy, PutBucketPolicy, and
                        DeleteBucketPolicy API actions, even if their bucket policy
                     explicitly denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root principals can
                     only be blocked from performing these API actions by VPC endpoint policies and
                     AWS Organizations policies.

AmazonS3,GetObject,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html,"Retrieves an object from Amazon S3.

In the GetObject request, specify the full key name for the object.

General purpose buckets - Both the virtual-hosted-style
         requests and the path-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request
         example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the
         object key name as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request
         example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket
         named examplebucket, specify the object key name as
            /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about
         request types, see HTTP Host
            Header Bucket Specification in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Directory buckets -
         Only virtual-hosted-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named amzn-s3-demo-bucket--usw2-az1--x-s3, specify the object key name as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. Also, when you make requests to this API operation, your requests are sent to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket-name.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
      . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

Permissions
         
            
                
                
            
                  
                     General purpose bucket permissions - You
                        must have the required permissions in a policy. To use
                           GetObject, you must have the READ access to the
                        object (or version). If you grant READ access to the anonymous
                        user, the GetObject operation returns the object without using
                        an authorization header. For more information, see Specifying permissions in a policy in the
                           Amazon S3 User Guide.
                  If you include a versionId in your request header, you must
                        have the s3:GetObjectVersion permission to access a specific
                        version of an object. The s3:GetObject permission is not
                        required in this scenario.
                  If you request the current version of an object without a specific
                           versionId in the request header, only the
                           s3:GetObject permission is required. The
                           s3:GetObjectVersion permission is not required in this
                        scenario. 
                  If the object that you request doesn’t exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns
                        depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket
                        permission.
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the
                              bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found
                              error.
                     
                        If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3
                              returns an HTTP status code 403 Access Denied
                              error.
                     
               
                  
                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.
                  If
                        the
                        object is encrypted using SSE-KMS, you must also have the
                           kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions
                        in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS
                        key.
               
         
       
         Storage classes
         
            If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
                  storage class, the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, the
                  S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier, or the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier,
                  before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject. Otherwise, this operation returns an
                     InvalidObjectState error. For information about restoring archived
                  objects, see Restoring Archived
                     Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
            
               Directory buckets  -
                  Directory buckets only support EXPRESS_ONEZONE (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in Availability Zones and ONEZONE_IA (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.  
Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code 400 Bad Request.

            Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption,
                  should not be sent for the GetObject requests, if your object uses
                  server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), server-side
                  encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side
                  encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your
                     GetObject requests for the object that uses these types of keys,
                  you’ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error.
            
               Directory buckets -
                  For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more
         information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
         
       
         Overriding response header values through the request
         
            There are times when you want to override certain response header values of a
                     GetObject response. For example, you might override the
                     Content-Disposition response header value through your
                     GetObject request.
            You can override values for a set of response headers. These modified response
                  header values are included only in a successful response, that is, when the HTTP
                  status code 200 OK is returned. The headers you can override using
                  the following query parameters in the request are a subset of the headers that
                  Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. 
            The response headers that you can override for the GetObject
                  response are Cache-Control, Content-Disposition,
                     Content-Encoding, Content-Language,
                     Content-Type, and Expires.
            To override values for a set of response headers in the GetObject
                  response, you can use the following query parameters in the request.
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
            
                  
                     response-cache-control
                  
               
                  
                     response-content-disposition
                  
               
                  
                     response-content-encoding
                  
               
                  
                     response-content-language
                  
               
                  
                     response-content-type
                  
               
                  
                     response-expires
                  
               
            NoteWhen you use these parameters, you must sign the request by using either an
                     Authorization header or a presigned URL. These parameters cannot be used with
                     an unsigned (anonymous) request.

                        use GetObjectAttributes, you must have READ access to the
                        object. The permissions that you need to use this operation depend on
                        whether the bucket is versioned. If the bucket is versioned, you need both
                        the s3:GetObjectVersion and
                           s3:GetObjectVersionAttributes permissions for this
                        operation. If the bucket is not versioned, you need the

                        permissions. For more information, see Specifying

                        not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the
                           s3:ListBucket permission.

                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.
                  If
                        the
                        object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
                           kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions
                        in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS
                        key.
               
         
       
         Encryption
         
            NoteEncryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption,
                     should not be sent for HEAD requests if your object uses
                     server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer
                     server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side
                     encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The
                        x-amz-server-side-encryption header is used when you
                        PUT an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method.
                     If you include this header in a GET request for an object that
                     uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request
                     error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve
                     the object.
            If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided
                  encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve
                  the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the
                  encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The
                  headers are:

            For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side
                     Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide.
            Note
                  Directory bucket permissions -
                     For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your 
            CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects 
 are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more
         information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS for new object uploads.
         
       
         Versioning
         
            
               Directory buckets -
                  S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the null value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify null to the
                     versionId query parameter in the request.
         
       
         Conditional request headers
         
            Consider the following when using request headers:
            
                
                
            
                  If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since
                        headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP
                        status code 200 OK and the data requested:
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        
                           If-Match condition evaluates to
                              true.
                     
                        
                           If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to
                                 false.
                     
                  For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.
               
                  If both of the If-None-Match and
                           If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as
                        follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code 304 Not
                           Modified:
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        
                           If-None-Match condition evaluates to
                                 false.
                     
                        
                           If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to
                                 true.
                     
                  For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.

AmazonS3,GetPublicAccessBlock,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetPublicAccessBlock.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Retrieves the PublicAccessBlock configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. To use
         this operation, you must have the s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock permission.
         For more information about Amazon S3 permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a
            Policy.

ImportantWhen Amazon S3 evaluates the PublicAccessBlock configuration for a bucket or
            an object, it checks the PublicAccessBlock configuration for both the
            bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account. If the
               PublicAccessBlock settings are different between the bucket and the
            account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and
            account-level settings.

AmazonS3,HeadObject,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadObject.html,"The HEAD operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning the

NoteA HEAD request has the same options as a GET operation on
            an object. The response is identical to the GET response except that there
            is no response body. Because of this, if the HEAD request generates an
            error, it returns a generic code, such as 400 Bad Request, 403

                        use HEAD, you must have the s3:GetObject
                        permission. You need the relevant read object (or version) permission for
                        this operation. For more information, see Actions, resources, and
                           condition keys for Amazon S3 in the Amazon S3 User
                           Guide. For more information about the permissions to S3 API

                           Amazon S3 User Guide.
                  If the object you request doesn't exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns
                        depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket
                        permission.

                              error.

                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.
                  If you enable x-amz-checksum-mode in the request and the
                        object is encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), you must
                        also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt
                        permissions in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the
                        AWS KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.
               
         
       
         Encryption
         
            NoteEncryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption,
                     should not be sent for HEAD requests if your object uses
                     server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer
                     server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side
                     encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The
                        x-amz-server-side-encryption header is used when you
                        PUT an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method.
                     If you include this header in a HEAD request for an object that
                     uses these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request
                     error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve
                     the object.
            If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided
                  encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve
                  the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the
                  encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The
                  headers are:

            For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side
                     Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide.
            Note
                  Directory bucket  -
                     For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more
         information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

                  If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as
                        if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker:
                           true in the response.
               
                  If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a
                           405 Method Not Allowed error and the Last-Modified:

AmazonS3,ListBucketIntelligentTieringConfigurations,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBucketIntelligentTieringConfigurations.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Lists the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is  the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

For more information, see Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects.

AmazonS3,ListMultipartUploads,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListMultipartUploads.html,"This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket. An in-progress multipart
         upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by the
            CreateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet been completed or
         aborted.

Note
         Directory buckets - If multipart uploads in
            a directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the
            in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed. To delete these in-progress
            multipart uploads, use the ListMultipartUploads operation to list the
            in-progress multipart uploads in the bucket and use the
               AbortMultipartUpload operation to abort all the in-progress multipart
            uploads.

The ListMultipartUploads operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart
         uploads in the response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default value.
         You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the
            max-uploads request parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart
         uploads that satisfy your ListMultipartUploads request, the response returns
         an IsTruncated element with the value of true, a
            NextKeyMarker element, and a NextUploadIdMarker element. To
         list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent
            ListMultipartUploads requests. In these requests, include two query
         parameters: key-marker and upload-id-marker. Set the value of
            key-marker to the NextKeyMarker value from the previous
         response. Similarly, set the value of upload-id-marker to the
            NextUploadIdMarker value from the previous response.

Note
         Directory buckets - The
               upload-id-marker element and the NextUploadIdMarker element
            aren't supported by directory buckets. To list the additional multipart uploads, you
            only need to set the value of key-marker to the NextKeyMarker
            value from the previous response.

For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart
            Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Note
         Directory buckets -
            For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
         . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

                     General purpose bucket permissions - For
                        information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see
                           Multipart Upload and
                           Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
               
                  
                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.

                     General purpose bucket - In the
                           ListMultipartUploads response, the multipart uploads are
                        sorted based on two criteria:
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        Key-based sorting - Multipart uploads are initially sorted
                              in ascending order based on their object keys.
                     
                        Time-based sorting - For uploads that share the same object
                              key, they are further sorted in ascending order based on the upload
                              initiation time. Among uploads with the same key, the one that was
                              initiated first will appear before the ones that were initiated
                              later.
                     
               
                  
                     Directory bucket - In the
                           ListMultipartUploads response, the multipart uploads aren't
                        sorted lexicographically based on the object keys.

Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.

AmazonS3,ListParts,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html,"Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload.

To use this operation, you must provide the upload ID in the request. You
         obtain this uploadID by sending the initiate multipart upload request through CreateMultipartUpload.

The ListParts request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The limit
         of 1,000 parts is also the default value. You can restrict the number of parts in a
         response by specifying the max-parts request parameter. If your multipart
         upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an IsTruncated
         field with the value of true, and a NextPartNumberMarker element.
         To list remaining uploaded parts, in subsequent ListParts requests, include
         the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value to the
            NextPartNumberMarker field value from the previous response.

AmazonS3,PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Sets the accelerate configuration of an existing bucket. Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a
         bucket-level feature that enables you to perform faster data transfers to Amazon S3.

To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
            s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission
         by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information
         about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing
            Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.

The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the following two
         values:

Enabled – Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.
      
          Suspended – Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.

The GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration action returns the transfer acceleration state
         of a bucket.

After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it might take up
         to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the bucket increase.

The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and must
         not contain periods (""."").

For more information about transfer acceleration, see Transfer
         Acceleration.

AmazonS3,PutBucketAcl,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAcl.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more
         information, see Using ACLs. To set the ACL of a
         bucket, you must have the WRITE_ACP permission.

You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:

Specify the ACL in the request body
      
         Specify permissions using request headers

NoteYou cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request
            headers.

Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using
         either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application
         that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that
         approach.

ImportantIf your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs
            are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to
            your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return
            the AccessControlListNotSupported error code. Requests to read ACLs are
            still supported. For more information, see Controlling object
               ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Permissions
         
            You can set access permissions by using one of the following methods:
            
                
                
            
                  Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3
                        supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned
                        ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and
                        permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of
                           x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other
                        access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see
                           Canned
                        ACL.
               
                  Specify access permissions explicitly with the
                           x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp,
                           x-amz-grant-write-acp, and
                           x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers,
                        you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3
                        groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific
                        headers, you cannot use the x-amz-acl header to set a canned
                        ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an
                        ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL)
                           Overview.
                  You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of
                        the following:
                  
                      
                      
                      
                  
                        
                           id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID
                              of an AWS account
                        
                     
                        
                           uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined
                              group
                     
                        
                           emailAddress – if the value specified is the email
                              address of an AWS account
                        
                        NoteUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:

                  For example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants
                        create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group
                        predefined by Amazon S3 and two AWS accounts identified by their email
                        addresses.
                  
                     x-amz-grant-write:
                           uri=""http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery"", id=""111122223333"",

            You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You
                  cannot do both.
         
       
         Grantee Values
         
            You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights
                  (using request elements) in the following ways:
            
                
                
                
            
                  By the person's ID:
                  
                     <Grantee xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""

                  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request
               
                  By URI:
                  
                     <Grantee xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""

AmazonS3,PutBucketAnalyticsConfiguration,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAnalyticsConfiguration.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Sets an analytics configuration for the bucket (specified by the analytics configuration
         ID). You can have up to 1,000 analytics configurations per bucket.

You can choose to have storage class analysis export analysis reports sent to a
         comma-separated values (CSV) flat file. See the DataExport request element.
         Reports are updated daily and are based on the object filters that you configure. When
         selecting data export, you specify a destination bucket and an optional destination prefix
         where the file is written. You can export the data to a destination bucket in a different
         account. However, the destination bucket must be in the same Region as the bucket that you
         are making the PUT analytics configuration to. For more information, see Amazon S3
            Analytics – Storage Class Analysis.

ImportantYou must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket where the exported file is
            written to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket. For an example
            policy, see Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
            s3:PutAnalyticsConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission

AmazonS3,PutBucketCors,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketCors.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Sets the cors configuration for your bucket. If the configuration exists,
         Amazon S3 replaces it.

To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the s3:PutBucketCORS
         action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.

You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin
         requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is
            http://www.example.com to access your Amazon S3 bucket at
            my.example.bucket.com by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest
         capability.

To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the
            cors subresource to the bucket. The cors subresource is an XML
         document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can
         be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.

When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a
         bucket, it evaluates the cors configuration on the bucket and uses the first
            CORSRule rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a
         cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:

The request's Origin header must match AllowedOrigin
               elements.
      
         The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the
                  Access-Control-Request-Method header in case of a pre-flight
                  OPTIONS request must be one of the AllowedMethod
               elements. 
      
         Every header specified in the Access-Control-Request-Headers request
               header of a pre-flight request must match an AllowedHeader element.

         bucket.

Note
         Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name
         . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported.

By default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that uses server-side
         encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

                  You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using
                        server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer
                        server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you specify
                        default encryption by using SSE-KMS, you can also configure Amazon S3
                           Bucket Keys. For information about the bucket default encryption
                        feature, see Amazon S3 Bucket Default
                           Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. 
               
                  If you use PutBucketEncryption to set your default bucket
                           encryption to SSE-KMS, you should verify that your KMS key ID
                        is correct. Amazon S3 doesn't validate the KMS key ID provided in
                        PutBucketEncryption requests.
               
         
            
               Directory buckets  - You can
                  optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side
                  encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).
            
                
                
                
                
                
            
                  We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired
                        encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default
                        encryption in your CreateSession requests or PUT
                        object requests. Then, new objects are automatically encrypted with the
                        desired encryption settings.
                        For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS for new object uploads.
               
                  Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket's lifetime. 
The AWS managed key (aws/s3) isn't supported. 

               
                  S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for GET and PUT operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets  
to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through CopyObject, UploadPartCopy, the Copy operation in Batch Operations, or 
                            the import jobs. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to AWS KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.
               
                  When you specify an AWS KMS customer managed key for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.
               
                  For directory buckets, if you use PutBucketEncryption to set your default bucket encryption to SSE-KMS, Amazon S3 validates the
                        KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.

ImportantIf you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully
            qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then AWS KMS resolves the
            key within the requester’s account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted
            with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner.Also, this action requires AWS Signature Version 4. For more information, see
                Authenticating
               Requests (AWS Signature Version 4).

Puts a S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration to the specified bucket. You can have up to
         1,000 S3 Intelligent-Tiering configurations per bucket.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities.

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is  the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

AmazonS3,PutBucketInventoryConfiguration,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketInventoryConfiguration.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

This implementation of the PUT action adds an inventory configuration
         (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 inventory
         configurations per bucket.

Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily or weekly
         basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is inventoried is
         called the source bucket, and the bucket where the inventory flat file
         is stored is called the destination bucket. The
            destination bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the
            source bucket.

When you configure an inventory for a source bucket, you specify
         the destination bucket where you want the inventory to be stored, and
         whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also configure what object
         metadata to include and whether to inventory all object versions or only current versions.
         For more information, see Amazon S3 Inventory in the
         Amazon S3 User Guide.

ImportantYou must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket to
            grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in the defined location. For an
            example policy, see  Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis.

Permissions
         
            To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
                     s3:PutInventoryConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this
                  permission by default and can grant this permission to others. 
            The s3:PutInventoryConfiguration permission allows a user to
                  create an S3 Inventory
                  report that includes all object metadata fields available and to specify the
                  destination bucket to store the inventory. A user with read access to objects in
                  the destination bucket can also access all object metadata fields that are
                  available in the inventory report. 
            To restrict access to an inventory report, see Restricting access to an Amazon S3 Inventory report in the

ImportantFor an updated version of this API, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration. This version has been deprecated. Existing
            lifecycle configurations will work. For new lifecycle configurations, use the updated
            API.

NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing lifecycle
         configuration. For information about lifecycle configuration, see Object
            Lifecycle Management in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

By default, all Amazon S3 resources, including buckets, objects, and related subresources
         (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration) are private. Only the
         resource owner, the AWS account that created the resource, can access it. The resource
         owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For
         this operation, users must get the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration
         permission.

You can also explicitly deny permissions. Explicit denial also supersedes any other
         permissions. If you want to prevent users or accounts from removing or deleting objects
         from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

s3:DeleteObject
         
      
         
            s3:DeleteObjectVersion

Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for who can view and
         modify the logging parameters. All logs are saved to buckets in the same AWS Region as
         the source bucket. To set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket
         owner.

The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You use the
            Grantee request element to grant access to other people. The
            Permissions request element specifies the kind of access the grantee has to
         the logs.

ImportantIf the target bucket for log delivery uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3
            Object Ownership, you can't use the Grantee request element to grant access
            to others. Permissions can only be granted using policies. For more information, see
               Permissions for server access log delivery in the
               Amazon S3 User Guide.

Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more information about event
         notifications, see Configuring Event
         Notifications.

Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The
         configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and
         the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an
         event of the specified type.

By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification
         configuration will be an empty NotificationConfiguration.

<NotificationConfiguration>

</NotificationConfiguration>

This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you
         include in the request body.

After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification
         Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and
         that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In
         the case of AWS Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions
         grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information,
         see Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events.

You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration
         element.

For more information about the number of event notification configurations that you can
         create per bucket, see Amazon S3 service quotas in 
         AWS
            General Reference.

By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However,
         bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this
         configuration with the required s3:PutBucketNotification permission.

NoteThe PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification
            configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When
            you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS
            topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the
            configuration to your bucket.

If the configuration in the request body includes only one
            TopicConfiguration specifying only the
            s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event type, the response will also include
         the x-amz-sns-test-message-id header containing the message ID of the test
         notification sent to the topic.

Permissions
         
            If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that
                  owns the bucket, the calling identity must both have the
                     PutBucketPolicy permissions on the specified bucket and belong to
                  the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.
            If you don't have PutBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a
                     403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but
                  you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3
                  returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.
            ImportantTo ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of
                     their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's AWS account can
                     perform the GetBucketPolicy, PutBucketPolicy, and

AmazonS3,PutBucketReplication,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketReplication.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Creates a replication configuration or replaces an existing one. For more information,
         see Replication in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication
         configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want
         Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your
         behalf, and other relevant information. You can invoke this request for a specific AWS
         Region by using the aws:RequestedRegion condition key.

A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of
         1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in
         the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for
         each subset.

To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to,
         add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an
         object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the
         configuration, you must also add the following elements:
            DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and
         Priority.

NoteIf you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles
            replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see Backward Compatibility.

For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Using Versioning.

Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects
         
            By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using
                  server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate AWS KMS-encrypted objects,
                  add the following: SourceSelectionCriteria,
                     SseKmsEncryptedObjects, Status,
                     EncryptionConfiguration, and ReplicaKmsKeyID. For
                  information about replication configuration, see Replicating
                     Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys.

         Permissions
         
            To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have
                     s3:PutReplicationConfiguration permissions for the bucket.
                  
               
            By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created the

Sets the tags for a bucket.

Use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this,
         sign up to get your AWS account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost
         of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the
         same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application
         name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application
         across several services. For more information, see Cost Allocation and
            Tagging and Using Cost Allocation in Amazon S3
            Bucket Tags.

Note When this operation sets the tags for a bucket, it will overwrite any current tags
            the bucket already has. You cannot use this operation to add tags to an existing list of
            tags.

To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the

NoteWhen you enable versioning on a bucket for the first time, it might take a short
            amount of time for the change to be fully propagated. While this change is propagating,
            you might encounter intermittent HTTP 404 NoSuchKey errors for requests to
            objects created or updated after enabling versioning. We recommend that you wait for 15
            minutes after enabling versioning before issuing write operations (PUT or
            DELETE) on objects in the bucket.

Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:

Enabled—Enables versioning for the objects in the
         bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

Suspended—Disables versioning for the objects in the
         bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a
            GetBucketVersioning request does not return a versioning state value.

In order to enable MFA Delete, you must be the bucket owner. If you are the bucket owner
         and want to enable MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, you must include the
            x-amz-mfa request header and the Status and the
            MfaDelete request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the
         bucket.

ImportantIf you have an object expiration lifecycle configuration in your non-versioned bucket
            and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning,
            you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent expiration lifecycle
            configuration will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions in the
            version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more
            noncurrent object versions.) For more information, see Lifecycle and Versioning.

         with website configuration information such as the file name of the index document and any
         redirect rules. For more information, see Hosting Websites on Amazon S3.

This PUT action requires the S3:PutBucketWebsite permission. By default,
         only the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket
         owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a bucket policy
         that grants them the S3:PutBucketWebsite permission.

To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add a
         website configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are sent to another
         website, you don't need to provide index document name for the bucket.

Note
          
          
          
      
            Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added
                  the entire object to the bucket. You cannot use PutObject to only
                  update a single piece of metadata for an existing object. You must put the entire
                  object with updated metadata if you want to update some values.
         
            If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership,
                  ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. All objects written to the
                  bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.
         
            
               Directory buckets -
                  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
               . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object
         simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. However, Amazon S3 provides
         features that can modify this behavior:

S3 Object Lock - To prevent objects from
               being deleted or overwritten, you can use Amazon S3 Object
                  Lock in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
         NoteThis functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
      
         
            If-None-Match - Uploads the object only if the object key name does not already exist in the specified bucket. Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns a 412 Precondition Failed error. If a conflicting operation occurs during the upload, S3 returns a 409 ConditionalRequestConflict response. On a 409 failure, retry the upload.
         Expects the * character (asterisk).
         For more information, see Add preconditions to S3 operations with conditional requests in the Amazon S3 User Guide or RFC 7232.
            
         NoteThis functionality is not supported for S3 on Outposts.
      
         
            S3 Versioning - When you enable versioning
               for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object
               simultaneously, it stores all versions of the objects. For each write request that is
               made to the same object, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID of that
               object being stored in Amazon S3. You can retrieve, replace, or delete any version of the
               object. For more information about versioning, see Adding
                  Objects to Versioning-Enabled Buckets in the Amazon S3 User
                  Guide. For information about returning the versioning state of a
               bucket, see GetBucketVersioning. 
         NoteThis functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

                     General purpose bucket permissions - The
                        following permissions are required in your policies when your
                           PutObject request includes specific headers.

                              To successfully complete the PutObject request, you must
                              always have the s3:PutObject permission on a bucket to
                              add an object to it.

                            - To successfully change the objects ACL of your
                                 PutObject request, you must have the
                                 s3:PutObjectAcl.

                                 PutObject request, you must have the
                                 s3:PutObjectTagging.
                     
               
                  
                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.
                  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
                           kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions
                        in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS
                        key.

                           Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks
                        the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, Amazon S3
                        returns an error. Alternatively, when the object's ETag is its MD5 digest,
                        you can calculate the MD5 while putting the object to Amazon S3 and compare the
                        returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

AmazonS3,PutObjectAcl,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObjectAcl.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Uses the acl subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions
         for a new or existing object in an S3 bucket. You must have the WRITE_ACP
         permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see What
            permissions can I grant? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using
         either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application
         that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach.
         For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview
         in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

ImportantIf your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs
            are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to
            your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return
            the AccessControlListNotSupported error code. Requests to read ACLs are
            still supported. For more information, see Controlling object
               ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Permissions
         
            You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:
            
                
                
            
                  Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3
                        supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has
                        a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as
                        the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use
                        other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information,
                        see Canned
                        ACL.
               
                  Specify access permissions explicitly with the
                           x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp,
                           x-amz-grant-write-acp, and
                           x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers,
                        you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3
                        groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific
                        headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL.
                        These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL.
                        For more information, see Access Control List (ACL)
                           Overview.
                  You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of
                        the following:
                  
                      
                      
                      
                  
                        
                           id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID

Sets the supplied tag-set to an object that already exists in a bucket. A tag is a
         key-value pair. For more information, see Object Tagging.

You can associate tags with an object by sending a PUT request against the tagging
         subresource that is associated with the object. You can retrieve tags by sending a GET
         request. For more information, see GetObjectTagging.

For tagging-related restrictions related to characters and encodings, see Tag

                  S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the
                  S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive
                  storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a
                  temporary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the
                  object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket.
                  To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number
                  of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive
                  Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request,
                  and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier.
            To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you
                  don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.
            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data
                  access tier options in the Tier element of the request body: 
            
                
                
                
            
                  
                     Expedited - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access
                        your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests
                        for restoring archives are required. For all but the largest archived
                        objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically
                        made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that
                        retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it.
                        Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects
                        stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or
                        S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
               
                  
                     Standard - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of
                        your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for
                        retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard
                        retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the
                        S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or
                        S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for
                        objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or
                        S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored
                        in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
               
                  
                     Bulk - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the
                        S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes,
                        enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost.
                        Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the
                        S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class or
                        S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the lowest-cost
                        retrieval option when restoring objects from
                        S3 Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for
                        objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or
                        S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. 
               
            For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity
                  for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived
                     Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide. 
            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster
                  speed while it is in progress. For more information, see  Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in the
                     Amazon S3 User Guide. 
            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD
                  request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides
                  information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event
                  notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more
                  information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event
                     Notifications in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by
                  reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period
                  relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no
                  data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is
                  actively processing your current restore request for the object.
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an
                  expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify
                  in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but
                  the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days.
                  For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle
                     Management in Amazon S3 User Guide.
         
       
         Responses
         
            A successful action returns either the 200 OK or 202
                     Accepted status code.

This action filters the contents of an Amazon S3 object based on a simple structured query
         language (SQL) statement. In the request, along with the SQL expression, you must also
         specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3 uses
         this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the
         specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data serialization format for the
         response.

This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.

For more information about Amazon S3 Select, see Selecting Content from
            Objects and SELECT
            Command in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Permissions
         
            You must have the s3:GetObject permission for this operation. Amazon S3
                  Select does not support anonymous access. For more information about permissions,
                  see Specifying Permissions in
                     a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
         
       
         Object Data Formats
         
            You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following format
                  properties:
            
                
                
                
                
            
                  
                     CSV, JSON, and Parquet - Objects must be in CSV,
                        JSON, or Parquet format.
               
                  
                     UTF-8 - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select
                        supports.
               
                  
                     GZIP or BZIP2 - CSV and JSON files can be compressed
                        using GZIP or BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that
                        Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar
                        compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support
                        whole-object compression for Parquet objects.
               
                  
                     Server-side encryption - Amazon S3 Select supports
                        querying objects that are protected with server-side encryption.
                  For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys
                        (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are
                        documented in the GetObject. For more
                        information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys)
                        in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
                  For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) and
                        AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently,
                        so you don't need to specify anything. For more information about
                        server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the
                           Amazon S3 User Guide.
               
         
       
         Working with the Response Body
         
            Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a
                  series of messages and includes a Transfer-Encoding header with
                     chunked as its value in the response. For more information, see
                     Appendix:

                  Response.
         
       
         GetObject Support
         
            The SelectObjectContent action does not support the following

AmazonS3,UploadPart,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html,"Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

NoteIn this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request.
            However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for
            the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.

You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload)
         before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an
         upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request.

Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely
         identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you
         upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the
         previously uploaded part is overwritten.

For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload
         specifications, see Multipart upload limits in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

NoteAfter you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either
            complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the
            uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up
            the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.

For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the
            Amazon S3 User Guide .

Note
         Directory buckets -
            For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3express-zone-id.region-code.amazonaws.com/key-name
         . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.

Permissions
         
            
                
                
            
                  
                     General purpose bucket permissions - To
                        perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS Key Management Service key, the
                        requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and
                           kms:GenerateDataKey actions on the key. The requester must
                        also have permissions for the kms:GenerateDataKey action for
                        the CreateMultipartUpload API. Then, the requester needs
                        permissions for the kms:Decrypt action on the
                           UploadPart and UploadPartCopy APIs.
                  These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data
                        from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For
                        more information about KMS permissions, see Protecting data
                           using server-side encryption with AWS KMS in the
                           Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about the
                        permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart upload and permissions and Multipart upload API and permissions in the
                           Amazon S3 User Guide.
               
                  
                     Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use. 
AWS CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see CreateSession.
                  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
                           kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions
                        in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS
                        key.
               
         
       
         Data integrity
         
            
               General purpose bucket - To ensure that data
                  is not corrupted traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5
                  header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided
                  MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is
                  signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3 uses the
                     x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum instead of
                     Content-MD5. For more information see Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature
                     Version 4). 
            Note
                  Directory buckets - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You can use checksum algorithms to check object integrity.
         
       
         Encryption
         
            
                
                
            
                  
                     General purpose bucket - Server-side
                        encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
                        writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it.
                        You have mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side
                        encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption
                        keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys
                        (SSE-S3), AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
                        Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys
                        (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest
                        using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use
                        depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own
                        encryption key (SSE-C).
                  Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload
                        operations. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C),
                        you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart
                        request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption
                        parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information,
                        see CreateMultipartUpload.
                  If you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided
                        encryption key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you must
                        provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the
                        following request headers.

Authentication and authorization
         
            All UploadPartCopy requests must be authenticated and signed by
                  using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM
                  identities). All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including
                     x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. For more information, see
                     REST Authentication.
            
               Directory buckets - You must use IAM
                  credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the
                     UploadPartCopy API operation, instead of using the temporary
                  security credentials through the CreateSession API operation.

                        To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS Key Management Service
                              key, the requester must have permission to the
                                 kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey
                              actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the
                                 kms:GenerateDataKey action for the
                                 CreateMultipartUpload API. Then, the requester needs
                              permissions for the kms:Decrypt action on the
                                 UploadPart and UploadPartCopy APIs. These
                              permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from
                              the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For
                              more information about KMS permissions, see Protecting
                                 data using server-side encryption with AWS KMS in the

                     Directory bucket permissions -
                        You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the
                        source and destination bucket types in an UploadPartCopy
                        operation.
                  
                      
                      
                  
                        If the source object that you want to copy is in a
                              directory bucket, you must have the 
                              s3express:CreateSession
                            permission in
                              the Action element of a policy to read the object. By
                              default, the session is in the ReadWrite mode. If you
                              want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the
                                 s3express:SessionMode condition key to
                                 ReadOnly on the copy source bucket.
                     
                        If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the
                                 
                              s3express:CreateSession
                            permission in the
                                 Action element of a policy to write the object to the
                              destination. The s3express:SessionMode condition key
                              cannot be set to ReadOnly on the copy destination.
                           
                     
                  If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the
                           kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions
                        in IAM identity-based policies and AWS KMS key policies for the AWS KMS
                        key.
                  For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for

                     Directory buckets  -
                        For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). For more
         information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
                  NoteFor directory buckets, when you perform a
                              CreateMultipartUpload operation and an
                              UploadPartCopy operation, the request headers you provide
                           in the CreateMultipartUpload request must match the default
                           encryption configuration of the destination bucket. 
                  S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets  
to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through UploadPartCopy. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to AWS KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.

AmazonS3,WriteGetObjectResponse,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_WriteGetObjectResponse.html,"NoteThis operation is not supported for directory buckets.

Passes transformed objects to a GetObject operation when using Object Lambda access points. For
         information about Object Lambda access points, see Transforming objects with
            Object Lambda access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

This operation supports metadata that can be returned by GetObject, in addition to
            RequestRoute, RequestToken, StatusCode,
            ErrorCode, and ErrorMessage. The GetObject
         response metadata is supported so that the WriteGetObjectResponse caller,
         typically an AWS Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it internally invokes
            GetObject. When WriteGetObjectResponse is called by a
         customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the end user
            GetObject call might differ from what Amazon S3 would normally return.

You can include any number of metadata headers. When including a metadata header, it
         should be prefaced with x-amz-meta. For example,
            x-amz-meta-my-custom-header: MyCustomValue. The primary use case for this
         is to forward GetObject metadata.

AWS provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object Lambda to
         detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects.
         These Lambda functions are available in the AWS Serverless Application Repository, and
         can be selected through the AWS Management Console when you create your Object Lambda access point.

Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a
         natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and
         relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable information (PII)
         such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from
         documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.

Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural
         language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships
         in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names,
         addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your
         Amazon S3 bucket.

Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is
         equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including
         bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.

bedrock_agent,CreateKnowledgeBase,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_CreateKnowledgeBase.html,"Creates a knowledge base. A knowledge base contains your data sources so that Large Language Models (LLMs) can use your data. To create a knowledge base, you must first set up your data sources and configure a supported vector store. For more information, see Set up a knowledge base.

NoteIf you prefer to let Amazon Bedrock create and manage a vector store for you in Amazon OpenSearch Service, use the console. For more information, see Create a knowledge base.

Provide the name and an optional description.
      
         Provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with permissions to create a knowledge base in the roleArn field.
      
         Provide the embedding model to use in the embeddingModelArn field in the knowledgeBaseConfiguration object.
      
         Provide the configuration for your vector store in the storageConfiguration object.
         
             
             
             
             
         
               For an Amazon OpenSearch Service database, use the opensearchServerlessConfiguration object. For more information, see Create a vector store in Amazon OpenSearch Service.
            
               For an Amazon Aurora database, use the RdsConfiguration object. For more information, see Create a vector store in Amazon Aurora.
            
               For a Pinecone database, use the pineconeConfiguration object. For more information, see Create a vector store in Pinecone.

Important Computer use is a new Anthropic Claude model capability (in beta) available with Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 only. When operating computer use functionality, we recommend taking additional security precautions, such as executing computer actions in virtual environments with restricted data access and limited internet connectivity. For more information, see Configure an Amazon Bedrock Agent to complete tasks with computer use tools. ANTHROPIC.Computer - Gives the agent permission to use the mouse and keyboard and take screenshots. ANTHROPIC.TextEditor - Gives the agent permission to view, create and edit files. ANTHROPIC.Bash - Gives the agent permission to run commands in a bash shell. During orchestration, if your agent determines that it needs to invoke an API in an action group, but doesn't have enough information to complete the API request, it will invoke this action group instead and return an Observation reprompting the user for more information.

bedrock_runtime,Converse,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html,"Sends messages to the specified Amazon Bedrock model. Converse provides
         a consistent interface that works with all models that
         support messages. This allows you to write code once and use it with different models.
         If a model has unique inference parameters, you can also pass those unique parameters
         to the model.

Amazon Bedrock doesn't store any text, images, or documents that you provide as content. The data is only used to generate the response.

You can submit a prompt by including it in the messages field, specifying the modelId of a foundation model or inference profile to run inference on it, and including any other fields that are relevant to your use case.

You can also submit a prompt from Prompt management by specifying the ARN of the prompt version and including a map of variables to values in the promptVariables field. You can append more messages to the prompt by using the messages field. If you use a prompt from Prompt management, you can't include the following fields in the request: additionalModelRequestFields, inferenceConfig, system, or toolConfig. Instead, these fields must be defined through Prompt management. For more information, see Test a prompt using Prompt management.

For information about the Converse API, see 
            Use the Converse API.
            To use a guardrail, see  Use a guardrail with the Converse API.
            To use a tool with a model, see Tool use (Function calling).

For example code, see 
         Converse API examples.

This operation requires permission for the bedrock:InvokeModel action.

ImportantTo deny all inference access to resources that you specify in the modelId field, you
         need to deny access to the bedrock:InvokeModel and
         bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream actions. Doing this also denies
         access to the resource through the base inference actions (InvokeModel and InvokeModelWithResponseStream). For more information see Deny access for inference on specific models.

bedrock_runtime,ConverseStream,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_ConverseStream.html,"Sends messages to the specified Amazon Bedrock model and returns
         the response in a stream. ConverseStream provides a consistent API
         that works with all Amazon Bedrock models that support messages.
         This allows you to write code once and use it with different models. Should a
         model have unique inference parameters, you can also pass those unique parameters to the
         model.

To find out if a model supports streaming, call GetFoundationModel
         and check the responseStreamingSupported field in the response.

NoteThe AWS CLI doesn't support streaming operations in Amazon Bedrock, including ConverseStream.

Amazon Bedrock doesn't store any text, images, or documents that you provide as content. The data is only used to generate the response.

You can submit a prompt by including it in the messages field, specifying the modelId of a foundation model or inference profile to run inference on it, and including any other fields that are relevant to your use case.

You can also submit a prompt from Prompt management by specifying the ARN of the prompt version and including a map of variables to values in the promptVariables field. You can append more messages to the prompt by using the messages field. If you use a prompt from Prompt management, you can't include the following fields in the request: additionalModelRequestFields, inferenceConfig, system, or toolConfig. Instead, these fields must be defined through Prompt management. For more information, see Test a prompt using Prompt management.

For information about the Converse API, see 
         Use the Converse API.
         To use a guardrail, see  Use a guardrail with the Converse API.
         To use a tool with a model, see Tool use (Function calling).

For example code, see 
         Conversation streaming example.

This operation requires permission for the bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream action.

ImportantTo deny all inference access to resources that you specify in the modelId field, you
         need to deny access to the bedrock:InvokeModel and
         bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream actions. Doing this also denies
         access to the resource through the base inference actions (InvokeModel and InvokeModelWithResponseStream). For more information see Deny access for inference on specific models.
