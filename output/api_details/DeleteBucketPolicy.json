These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name\n         . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported. \nFor more information about endpoints in Availability Zones, see Regional and Zonal endpoints for directory buckets in Availability Zones in the\n    Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about endpoints in Local Zones, see Concepts for directory buckets in Local Zones in the\n    Amazon S3 User Guide.\n\nPermissions\n         \n            If you are using an identity other than the root user of the AWS account that\n                  owns the bucket, the calling identity must both have the\n                     DeleteBucketPolicy permissions on the specified bucket and belong\n                  to the bucket owner's account in order to use this operation.\n            If you don't have DeleteBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a\n                     403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but\n                  you're not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3\n                  returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.\n            ImportantTo ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of\n                     their own buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's AWS account can\n                     perform the GetBucketPolicy, PutBucketPolicy, and\n                        DeleteBucketPolicy API actions, even if their bucket policy\n                     explicitly denies the root principal's access.
