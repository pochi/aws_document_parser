  "description": "Deletes the lifecycle configuration from the specified bucket. Amazon S3 removes all the\n         lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the bucket. Your\n         objects never expire, and Amazon S3 no longer automatically deletes any objects on the basis of\n         rules contained in the deleted lifecycle configuration.\n\nPermissions\n         \n            \n                \n            \n                  \n                     General purpose bucket permissions - By\n                        default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and\n                        related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website\n                        configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the AWS account that\n                        created it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant\n                        access permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this\n                        operation, a user must have the s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration\n                        permission.\n                  For more information about permissions, see Managing Access\n                           Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.\n               \n            \n                \n            \n                  \n                     Directory bucket permissions -\n                        You must have the s3express:PutLifecycleConfiguration\n                        permission in an IAM identity-based policy to use this operation.\n                        Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. The resource\n                        owner can optionally grant access permissions to others by creating a role\n                        or user for them as long as they are within the same account as the owner\n                        and resource.\n                  For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see\n                           Authorizing Regional endpoint APIs with IAM in the\n                           Amazon S3 User Guide.\n                  Note\n                        Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name\n                        .
